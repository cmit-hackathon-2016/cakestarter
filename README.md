# CakeStarter



## The game
The purpose of the game is that you want Cake, but are not willing to get it. CakeStarter is the ideal crowd(cake)funding application to resolve your needs.

The players fund a game round by providing Bitcoins. The game round will continue until the pre-defined limit is reached. The player contributing the least amount of BTC of the round will be assigned the role of "CakeFetcher", and subsequently required to go and get the cake for the participants.

## Instructions
Do it

## Background
CakeStarter was created during a Nordea CMIT Hackathon in January of 2016
